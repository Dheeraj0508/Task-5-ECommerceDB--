# Task-5-ECommerceDB--
This repository contains my work for Task 5 of the SQL Developer Internship, focused on learning how to combine data from multiple tables using SQL joins. The goal of this task was to understand how different types of joins—INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL—work and how they help in merging related datasets.
